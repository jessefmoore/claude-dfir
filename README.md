## Case Overview

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Case ID | JackofAllHacks |
| Type | Intrusion + Ransomware Deployment |
| Threat Actor | Saiyan Spider |
| Incident Date | 2026-03-08 |
| Environment | Ludus cyber-range (QEMU/KVM, Windows Server 2022, LAF.local AD) |
| Tool | Claude Code + Protocol SIFT skills |

## What Happened

On 2026-03-08, threat actor **Saiyan Spider** exploited an OS command injection vulnerability in a public-facing IIS diagnostic page, escalated to SYSTEM via an unquoted SolarwindsTFTP service path, stole EC2 instance-role credentials via IMDS, pivoted to the Windows domain via Impacket, achieved Domain Admin in under 4 minutes, exfiltrated NTDS.dit + 164 S3 objects, and deployed `.bWqQUx` ransomware across the entire LAF.local domain. **Total time from first web request to domain compromise: ~25 minutes.**

## Evidence Summary

| Source | Records |
|---|---|
| CloudTrail (36,938 events) | Full parse |
| DC01/DC02 Security + System | 327k+ rows |
| SVR01 Memory dump (16 GB) | Volatility 3 full triage |
| WS01/WS02 all evtx | 1.75M+ rows incl. Sysmon |
| MFT (all 5 hosts) | Ransomware + tool timeline |
| IIS W3SVC logs | Full exploit chain |
| GuardDuty / S3 access logs | Cloud evidence |

## Interactive Casebook

`casebook_JackofAllHacks.html` is a self-contained interactive HTML report. Open it in any browser to get:

- **Kill-chain replay** — animated attack timeline with play/pause and 1×/60×/240×/900× speed
- **SVG attack graph** — color-coded forensic edges, host nodes that pulse as they fall; each event fires a popup tooltip near the active node showing the timestamp and description
- **Scrubber bar** — 15-minute ticks, event markers, and phase separators
- **Event log** — real-time event card updating during replay
- **28 forensic sections** — executive summary, act-by-act narrative, TTPs, IOCs, Volatility output, IIS artifacts, NTDS exfil, cloud pivot, memory analysis, evidence ledger, and appendices

All content is grounded in collected KAPE triage artifacts and Volatility 3 output. C2 binary RE analysis (not performed in this engagement) is explicitly omitted.

## Reusable Casebook Generator

`generate_dfir_casebook.py` adapts the reference template to any DFIR case. To generate a casebook for a new case:

```bash
# 1. Copy the generator and template to your case directory
cp generate_dfir_casebook.py /path/to/new-case/
cp reference_casebook.html   /path/to/new-case/

# 2. Populate engagement/ with these four files:
#      engagement.yaml   — case metadata (engagement_id, client, headline, tooling, …)
#      timeline.md       — ## Phase N · Name headers + | YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS | HOST | desc | source | rows
#      report.md         — findings narrative (F01–FXX)
#      hosts.csv         — host,ip,role,finding_id,proto,port,verdict

# 3. Run
python3 generate_dfir_casebook.py --case /path/to/new-case

# Output: casebook_<case_id>.html
```

The generator automatically:
- Removes the C2 RE-attribution section (requires separate binary analysis not in standard triage)
- Replaces all tool-specific attribution text with evidence-grounded language
- Redacts AWS AKIA and ASIA (STS) key IDs and secret keys for safe publication
- Injects the case timeline into the interactive replay engine
- **Builds a `HOST_NORM` map from `hosts.csv`** — translates timeline host names (e.g. `IIS-SERV-PROD`, `LAF-SVR01`) to the short SVG node IDs (`IIS`, `SVR01`) the attack graph uses, so host nodes pulse correctly during replay
- **Injects `flashNode()`** — positions a popup tooltip near the active SVG host node each time an event fires, showing the UTC timestamp and event description
- Reports an evidence integrity check (0 unsupported attribution claims)

## Attribution

The interactive casebook format — phosphor-green CRT aesthetic, kill-chain replay engine, animated SVG attack graph, scrubber bar, and overall report structure — is based on the **LeHack 2024 DFIR casebook** by [aleemladha](https://github.com/aleemladha). `reference_casebook.html` is that original work, used here as the base template for `generate_dfir_casebook.py`.
